 CLI
 Use the prettier command to run Prettier from the command line.

 prettier [options] [file/dir/glob ...]
 To run your locally installed version of Prettier, prefix the command with npx or yarn (if you use Yarn), i.e. npx prettier --help, or yarn prettier --help.

 To format a file in-place, use --write. (Note: This overwrites your files!)

 In practice, this may look something like:

 prettier --write .
 This command formats all files supported by Prettier in the current directory and its subdirectories.

 Itâ€™s recommended to always make sure that prettier --write . only formats what you want in your project. Use a .prettierignore file to ignore things that should not be formatted.

 A more complicated example:
